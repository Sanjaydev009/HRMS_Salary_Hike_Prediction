# Complete Employee Routing Structure - HRMS

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive employee routing system implemented in the HRMS application. The routing structure is organized to provide employees with a complete self-service portal for all their HR needs.

## Architecture

### 1. Main App Routing (`/frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- Simplified main routing with role-based access control
- Employee routes are handled by a dedicated Employee Router
- Uses `ProtectedRoute` component with enhanced role-based access control

### 2. Employee Router (`/frontend/src/pages/employee/EmployeeRouter.tsx`)
- Dedicated router for all employee-specific routes
- Organized by functional modules
- All routes are protected with `requiredRole="employee"`

### 3. Enhanced Protected Route (`/frontend/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- Added support for `requiredRole` and `allowedRoles` props
- Role-based access control with informative error messages
- Admin users have access to all routes by default

## Employee Route Structure

## Navigation Structure

### Employee Sidebar Navigation
The employee navigation is organized into logical groups:

1. **Dashboard** - Main landing page
2. **My Profile** - Profile management
3. **Attendance** - Time tracking and attendance
4. **Leave Management** - Complete leave lifecycle
5. **Payroll & Benefits** - Compensation and benefits
6. **Performance** - Goals and reviews
7. **Learning & Development** - Training and certifications
8. **Resources** - Documents and communication
9. **Settings** - Account preferences

## Components

### Key Components Created/Updated:

1. **EmployeeDashboard.tsx**
   - Comprehensive employee landing page
   - Quick actions and stats
   - Recent activities feed
   - Leave balance visualization

2. **EmployeeRouter.tsx**
   - Centralized routing for employee module
   - Role-based protection for all routes
   - Organized route structure

3. **ProtectedRoute.tsx** (Enhanced)
   - Role-based access control
   - Support for multiple roles
   - Informative access denied messages

4. **RoleBasedLayout.tsx** (Updated)
   - Enhanced employee navigation structure
   - Organized multi-level menus
   - Better UX with categorized options

## Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- All employee routes require `employee` role
- Admin users have access to all employee routes
- HR users have limited access to employee routes
- Clear access denied messages for unauthorized access

### Route Protection
```typescript
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="employee">
  <RoleBasedLayout>
    <ComponentName />
  </RoleBasedLayout>
</ProtectedRoute>
```

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed:
- Employee Router structure
- Enhanced ProtectedRoute with role support
- Employee Dashboard with stats and quick actions
- Updated navigation structure
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- Role-based access control

### ðŸ“‹ Ready for Implementation:
- Individual page components (placeholders created)
- API integration for employee-specific endpoints
- Real-time data integration
- Form validations and submissions

## Usage Example

### For Employee Users:
1. Login as employee
2. Navigate to `/employee/dashboard` (default)
3. Access any employee feature through sidebar navigation
4. All routes are properly protected and role-validated

### For Developers:
1. Add new employee routes in `EmployeeRouter.tsx`
2. Create corresponding components in `/pages/employee/`
3. Update navigation in `RoleBasedLayout.tsx` if needed
4. Ensure proper role protection using `ProtectedRoute`

## Benefits

1. **Organized Structure**: Clear separation of employee functionality
2. **Scalable**: Easy to add new employee features
3. **Secure**: Role-based access control throughout
4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and structure
5. **Maintainable**: Modular architecture with dedicated router
6. **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing

## Next Steps

1. Implement individual page components
2. Add API integration for real data
3. Implement form validations
4. Add error handling and loading states
5. Create comprehensive testing suite
6. Add accessibility features

This routing structure provides a solid foundation for a complete employee self-service portal within the HRMS application.
