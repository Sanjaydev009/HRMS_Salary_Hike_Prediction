### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file in the backend folder:

node test-email-system.js
```

Expected output for successful setup:
```

🎉 All tests passed! Email system is ready for production.
```

## 📧 Email System Workflow

### 1. Employee Creation Flow
```
HR/Admin Creates Employee → System Generates Temp Password → 
Employee Saved to DB → Welcome Email Sent → Employee Receives Credentials →
First Login → Mandatory Password Change → Welcome Complete
```

### 2. Password Reset Flow
```
User Clicks "Forgot Password" → Enters Email → Reset Token Generated →
Password Reset Email Sent → User Clicks Link → Enters New Password →
Password Updated → Confirmation Email Sent
```

### 3. Security Flow
```
All Password Changes → Confirmation Email Sent →
Failed Login Attempts Logged → Suspicious Activity Alerts
```

   ```

### Security Considerations

- Enable HTTPS for all links
- Monitor email delivery rates
- Log authentication attempts
- Set up email delivery monitoring

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

### Email Metrics to Track:
- Welcome email delivery rate
- Password reset completion rate
- First login success rate
- Email open rates (if using tracking)

### Security Metrics:
- Failed login attempts
- Password reset frequency
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Account lockout events

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Missing credentials for PLAIN"**
   - Solution: Set EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in .env file
   - Check: Gmail app password is 16 characters

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Solution: Verify 2FA is enabled on Gmail
   - Check: App password is correctly copied

3. **Emails not delivering**
   - Check: Spam/junk folders
   - Verify: Email address is correct
   - Test: Using email test script

4. **Password reset links expired**
   - Normal: Links expire in 15 minutes for security
   - Solution: Request new reset link

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test email configuration
node test-email-system.js

# Check environment variables
node -e "console.log(process.env.EMAIL_USER, process.env.EMAIL_PASS ? 'SET' : 'NOT_SET')"

# Test database connection
