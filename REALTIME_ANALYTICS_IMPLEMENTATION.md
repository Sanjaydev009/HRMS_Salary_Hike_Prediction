## Technical Implementation

### Backend APIs Used

1. **Dashboard Analytics** (`/api/analytics/dashboard`)
   ```javascript
   // Real-time employee, leave, and payroll statistics
   GET /api/analytics/dashboard
   ```

2. **Leave Analytics** (`/api/analytics/leave-trends`)
   ```javascript
   // Year and department filtered leave analysis
   GET /api/analytics/leave-trends?year=2025&department=Engineering
   ```

3. **Performance Analytics** (`/api/analytics/performance-insights`)
   ```javascript
   // Performance ratings and department comparisons
   GET /api/analytics/performance-insights?year=2025
   ```

### Frontend Implementation

#### Real-Time Data Fetching
```typescript
const fetchAnalyticsData = async () => {
  // Parallel API calls for better performance
  const [dashboardRes, leaveRes, performanceRes] = await Promise.all([
    fetch('/api/analytics/dashboard'),
    fetch('/api/analytics/leave-trends'),
    fetch('/api/analytics/performance-insights')
  ]);
  
  // Only set data if API calls are successful
  if (dashboardRes.ok) {
    setAnalyticsData(await dashboardRes.json());
  }
};
```

#### Conditional Rendering
```typescript
// Show chart only if data exists
{analyticsData && analyticsData.departmentStats.length > 0 ? (
  <ChartComponent data={analyticsData.departmentStats} />
) : (
  <EmptyStateMessage />
)}
```
